"""Speech to text, Marathi and Hindi. Regional language is a PS clause.

OWNER: Shruthi. Spec: docs/API_CONTRACT.md §4, docs/DESIGN.md §12.

Below `config.ASR_FLOOR`, `parsed_intent` is omitted and the client re-prompts.
`needs_confirmation` mirrors whether `parsed_intent` survived that gate: a
response that asks the farmer to confirm something the client was never shown
is a self-contradiction, so this module treats them as the same gate rather
than tracking a separate "consequential fields" concept.

Flag: ASR_PROVIDER = live | stub, read via app.voice.providers' factory. This
flag governs the whole voice pipeline (ASR, TTS, translate-before-embed), not
ASR alone: stub means no Sarvam call on any of the three, live means all three
hit Sarvam.

Live provider: Sarvam Saaras (config.SARVAM_STT_MODEL), transcribe mode — audio
in, native-script text out. The native transcript is the single source: it is
read back for confirmation AND fed to to_embedding_text() (docs/DESIGN.md §8).
The stub returns a fixed low-confidence transcript so the ASR_FLOOR re-prompt
path is exercised without a key or network.

S3 note: Sarvam reports no transcript-confidence number, so a provider may
return `confidence=None` (never a fabricated sentinel — see providers.py).
When that happens the floor gate below falls back to a transcript-quality
heuristic (empty transcript -> below-floor) instead of comparing to
`ASR_FLOOR`. This is a deliberate deviation from docs/API_CONTRACT.md §4's
always-numeric `confidence` example, flagged for the doc to catch up.
