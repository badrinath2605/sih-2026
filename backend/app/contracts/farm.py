"""Contract C2 · core -> everyone. docs/DESIGN.md §4, §5.

FROZEN at hour 2. Shreekumar produces these; every other workstream reads them.

Geolocation is required at creation. docs/DESIGN.md §4: "F6 and F15 are
inoperable without it, and retrofitting geometry after seed data exists is
painful." `location` is therefore non-optional here and NOT NULL in the ORM.

This is the wire/interchange shape. The `geography(Point, 4326)` column lives on
the ORM model in app/core/models.py (Phase 1); `GeoPoint` below is how that
column crosses a module boundary.
