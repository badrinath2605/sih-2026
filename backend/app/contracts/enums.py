#
#   diagnosable  the symptom is ON the surface the camera sees - lesions,
#                mosaics, spots, wilts, mould on a panicle.
#   inspection   the organism or its damage is not photographable in a way a
#                classifier can separate. A stem borer larva is inside the stem;
#                shoot fly damage looks like drought; whitefly is a 1 mm insect
#                on the leaf underside. Routing these through the gate would
#                produce a confident answer about something the image never
#                contained.
#
# This is a starting split, not a measurement. When Suchit has per-class recall,
# a `diagnosable` target the classifier cannot actually separate should move to
# `inspection` — that direction is always safe. Moving one the other way is not.
