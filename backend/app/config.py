deployment tuning for a perception floor, not a gate decision threshold, so it
is exempt from the "module constant, not a settings field" rule that GATE/
FLOOR/MARGIN carry. It still lives only here, per the rule directly above.

KNOWN GAP (raised at the Aug 29 vision-integration checkpoint, partially
mitigated by VISION_MIN_VEGETATION_FRACTION below, not fully closed): this
floor was derived from a coverage table of in-distribution paddy photos only.
On out-of-scope test images (non-plant photos) the real classifier returned
max-softmax as high as 0.87 / 0.72 / 0.54 / 0.9995 — none below this floor —
because a 4-class softmax with no rejection class concentrates mass somewhere
regardless of input. Raising this floor to catch those would also reject ~93%
of genuine paddy photos (per the same coverage table), so there is no single
softmax-only threshold fix. The vegetation-fraction pre-filter below catches
the specific failure mode observed (no green content at all) cheaply, without
retraining, but is a heuristic, not a learned rejection class — see
VISION_MIN_VEGETATION_FRACTION's own docstring for what it does and does not
cover. A trained negative/"normal" class (retrain) or shifting more of the
burden to Doubt Doctor's differential question remain open for Suchit/
Thaariha to weigh against this mitigation."""

"""Below this fraction of green/yellow-green pixels, the classifier declares
`out_of_scope=True` regardless of softmax confidence — a cheap, untrained
complement to OUT_OF_SCOPE_MAX_SOFTMAX above.

Why: the softmax floor alone missed every out-of-scope test image thrown at it
during integration (see the KNOWN GAP note above), including one non-plant
photo scored at 99.95% confidence. Measured on that same test set, real paddy
leaf photos ran ~98% vegetation-hued pixels; the failing non-plant photos ran
0.0%-6.8%. 0.15 sits with wide margin on both sides of that one data point —
it has not been validated against a broad image set, only the specific
failures observed on 2026-08-29.

What this does NOT catch: any out-of-scope subject that happens to be green
(a cucumber, a lawn, a different crop's leaf) — this is a vegetation detector,
not a paddy-leaf detector or a trained rejection class. It complements
OUT_OF_SCOPE_MAX_SOFTMAX; it does not replace the need for a real fix (see the
KNOWN GAP note)."""

OUT_OF_SCOPE_RAW_LOGIT_FLOOR = float(os.environ.get("VISION_OOS_RAW_LOGIT_FLOOR", "2.0"))
"""Below this raw (pre-temperature) max-logit, the classifier declares
`out_of_scope=True` — a third, independent complement to OUT_OF_SCOPE_MAX_SOFTMAX
and VISION_MIN_VEGETATION_FRACTION above. Same exemption as those two: perception
tuning, not a gate decision, so it is env-overridable rather than hardcoded.

Why pre-temperature, not post: `temperature` is fitted purely to calibrate the
*known* 4-class probabilities (docs/DESIGN.md §4) — it is optimized so that a
0.58 on an in-distribution photo means "right 58% of the time", and it cannot
change any argmax. It says nothing about whether the input belongs to that
distribution at all, and dividing by it before scoring can inflate an
out-of-distribution input's apparent confidence exactly the way
OUT_OF_SCOPE_MAX_SOFTMAX's KNOWN GAP describes (0.9995 on a fabric photo).
Scoring the raw logit sidesteps a rescaling that was never fit for this job.

KNOWN GAP, same honesty as the two constants above: this floor was set from the
same small ad-hoc probe used for VISION_MIN_VEGETATION_FRACTION (solid-color
squares standing in for non-plant input) plus a handful of unrelated real
photos found on the dev machine, not a genuine paddy-photo validation set —
none was available locally. In that probe, the solid-color squares scored
1.7-2.13 raw max-logit; ordinary real photos (portraits, objects) scored
2.6-11.85, i.e. *higher* than the synthetic non-plant proxies and on the same
order as a confident in-distribution prediction. So this floor, like the
softmax one, reliably catches only the specific failure shape it was set
against (flat, low-signal input) and should not be read as "raw-logit OOD
detection solved" — it is one more heuristic vote in the OR below, not a
replacement for a trained rejection class."""
