"""Bounded paddy classifier. Returns contract C1.

OWNER: Suchit. Spec: docs/DESIGN.md §3 (module boundaries), §4 (C1), §12 (flags).

`classify()` is the only entry point. It dispatches on `settings.vision_model`:

  real  -> the PyTorch classifier, served in-process (Suchit, Phase 2+)
  stub  -> the deliberately-inert distribution below

The stub is the one function in another owner's module that Phase 0 implements,
because a missing stub blocks everyone and a *bad* stub loses the demo.

The real path loads `weights/bhoomi_vision_v1.pth` + `.json` once, lazily, into
a module-level singleton (`_get_model()`). It never reads gate thresholds
(GATE/FLOOR/MARGIN live in intelligence's gate, not here) and never hardcodes
label strings — the JSON's `labels` list is the sole source of class-index
order, so a retrain that changes label order or count needs no code change
here.
