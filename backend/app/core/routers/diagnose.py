"""F2 the confidence gate, F3 image-based identification.

OWNER: Thaariha + Suchit; orchestration by Shreekumar

Serves:
    POST /farms/{id}/diagnose -- the orchestration (this file): load farm
        context, classify, apply the prior, call app.intelligence.gate.decide()
        (owner Thaariha, unmodified here), and branch. Two of the gate's three
        branches produce a real, complete response (escalate; clarify with no
        matching cue, which is the only clarify path reachable while
        DistinguishingCue is empty). advise, and clarify with a cue actually
        found, are real reachable states this build does not compose a
        response for -- 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED, not a bug: F7's advisory
        composer and F4's Doubt Doctor question flow are Thaariha's and are
        not built here. See _resolve_topk() and diagnose_farm() below.

    POST /vision/classify -- Phase 1 exception, vision fixture / test mode
        (owner Suchit). Returns contract C1 (TopK) unmodified and untouched
        by any gate logic, so any caller can drive all three gate bands by
        header. diagnose_farm() below reads the SAME header through the same
        _resolve_topk() this endpoint uses -- one fixture resolution, not two
        copies of the dict that could drift apart.

Specified by: docs/API_CONTRACT.md §6, docs/DESIGN.md §6, §7.
