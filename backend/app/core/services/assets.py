"""Asset bytes: the read side for ASR, the write side for TTS.

OWNER: Shreekumar. Spec: docs/DESIGN.md §3, §8 (v3), docs/API_CONTRACT.md §3, §4.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this exists

`core/routers/assets.py` only ever minted a presigned PUT for a client's own
upload — nothing in `core/` could read an object back, or write bytes the
*server* generated and hand back a URL. `app/voice/providers.py`'s
LiveSpeechToText and LiveTextToSpeech both documented this exact gap and
raised NotImplementedError naming it, rather than reaching into S3 or the
database directly from `voice/` and breaking the module boundary
docs/DESIGN.md §3 draws (`voice/` is Shruthi's, `core/` is the only package
that touches the database or object storage). These two functions are that
missing half.

`get_asset_bytes` -- READ side, for ASR. `store_bytes` -- WRITE side, for TTS.
Both take a session, like every other function in this package; `voice/` gets
typed results back, never a session of its own.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On `uploaded_at`

Nothing in the live app ever sets `Asset.uploaded_at` — only `seed/case_file.py`
does, for demo fixtures. `core/routers/assets.py`'s presign endpoint writes the
row before the client's PUT even starts, and nothing today confirms that PUT
landed. `get_asset_bytes` below does NOT gate on `uploaded_at` being non-null:
doing so would refuse every real asset a farmer has ever uploaded, since none
of them have it set. What it gates on instead is the only thing that is
actually true or false in the object store itself — whether `object_key`
resolves to a real object — which is the same fact `uploaded_at` was meant to
proxy for, checked directly instead of through a column nothing writes.

`store_bytes`, by contrast, DOES set `uploaded_at`. It is the one code path in
this codebase where the row and the bytes are written by the same call, so
"uploaded" is synchronously, provably true the moment the row is created —
not a promise about a client PUT that may or may not have happened yet.
