"""F15 - dashboard aggregates.

OWNER: Shreekumar

Hotspot points and confirmed-versus-corrected accuracy windows. Only confirmed
cases appear; model output alone never renders on an official's map.

Specified by: docs/API_CONTRACT.md §15.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derived from Confirmation rows on read. No counter table.

The Phase 1 decision, now in docs/DESIGN.md §5: "A
maintained counter can drift from its source; a query cannot." It also makes
§15's own rule — only confirmed cases appear — structurally true rather than
something a writer has to remember, because the aggregate IS the confirmation
rows. There is no path by which an unconfirmed diagnosis reaches this module.

    Grouped on `Confirmation.model_label` — what the model actually predicted,
    frozen at confirm time by migration 0006.

    This previously grouped on `Problem.label`, which on a correction has already
    been overwritten with the corrected label. A case where the model said blast
    and the agronomist corrected it to brown_spot was reported as a correction
    against BROWN_SPOT: the label the model never predicted carried the penalty,
    and the label it got wrong looked clean. F15's headline metric read the
    inverse of the truth.

    The question this answers is "of the times the model said X, how often was it
    right". A correction therefore counts against the model's label ONLY. It does
    not add a confirmation to the corrected label, because the model never
    predicted that label and crediting it there would inflate its accuracy with a
    case it had no part in.

    `LabelPrior` records both facts — the model was wrong about X and the truth
    was Y — because the prior is a record of what has been seen in a place. This
    view is a record of model performance. They are different questions and it is
    correct that they count differently.

    Rows with a NULL model_label are EXCLUDED, not bucketed. Those are
    confirmations on problems that never had a diagnosis (escalated from a
    follow-up rather than a photo) or that migration 0006 refused to guess. A
    case the model never saw is not evidence about the model.
