"""F5 - weather, season and phenology risk forecasting.

OWNER: Shreekumar

Open-Meteo pull, favourability scoring, issue_alerts(). Inspection tasks come
from the corpus when it exists and from seed until then; an empty task list
means no alert.

Specified by: docs/DESIGN.md §10.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine does not know how many targets exist.

`seed/risk_targets.json` is the registry. This module dispatches on each entry's
`driver` and is otherwise indifferent to the size of the file. A team question
is open about whether more targets are image-diagnosable or alert-and-inspect
only; whichever way it lands, it is a data edit here rather than a refactor.

Two drivers, one dispatcher:

    weather    scores from the Open-Meteo window (consecutive favourable days)
    phenology  scores from days-after-sowing, derived from Farm.sowing_date

An entry may declare both (`"driver": "weather+phenology"`), in which case BOTH
must be satisfied — hopper burn needs a humid canopy and a crop old enough to
have one.

The registry is validated against the FROZEN enums on load and the file is
refused otherwise. `target_label` and `crop` are frozen in
app/contracts/enums.py; a registry entry naming something outside them is a
silent no-op at best and an expansion nobody agreed to at worst.
