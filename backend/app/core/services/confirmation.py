"""F14 - the confirmation loop.

OWNER: Shreekumar

Writes the Confirmation, resolves the Problem, moves the prior, and fans out
spread alerts. All four in one transaction.

Specified by: docs/DESIGN.md §11, docs/API_CONTRACT.md §13.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One transaction, four effects.

    1. Write the Confirmation row.
    2. Resolve the Problem — and on `corrected`, set Problem.label to the
       corrected label. The case file should say what it actually was, not what
       the model guessed.
    3. Move the LabelPrior counters (services/prior.py).
    4. Fan out spread alerts (services/spread.py) and return the count.

They are one transaction because a half-applied confirmation is worse than none:
neighbours warned about a case that was never recorded, or a resolved problem
whose neighbours were never told. The caller commits; this function only
flushes, so a failure anywhere rolls all four back together.

Language discipline, docs/DESIGN.md §11: this is "learns from field
confirmations". Nothing here trains a model.
