"""Seed: seven farms across four crops, one farmer each, plus an agronomist and
an official.

OWNER: Shreekumar. Run from backend/:  python -m seed.farms

Idempotent — re-running matches on phone/email and updates rather than
duplicating.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The geometry is the point of this file.

docs/DESIGN.md §10's F6 fan-out is:

    SELECT id FROM farm
    WHERE crop = :crop AND id != :origin
      AND ST_DWithin(location, :origin_point, :radius);

with :radius = SPREAD_RADIUS_M (2000 m). A seed where every farm is inside the
radius proves nothing, because a broken query that returns everything looks
identical to a correct one. The paddy trio has proven itself since Phase 1 and
is untouched by V2:

    A  Gangapur      19.99730 N, 73.74140 E   paddy
    B  Anandvalli    19.99310 N, 73.75530 E   paddy
    C  Ozar          20.09280 N, 73.92860 E   paddy

    A - B    ~1_530 m    INSIDE  SPREAD_RADIUS_M (2000)
    A - C   ~22_300 m    outside
    B - C   ~21_100 m    outside

V2 adds four more farms — one each for cotton, soybean and jowar, plus a
second cotton farm — so F6's fan-out is proven on more than one crop:

    D  Yavatmal      20.38880 N, 78.12040 E   cotton   (Vidarbha cotton belt)
    E  Yavatmal-2     ~1_530 m from D          cotton   (same offset as A-B,
                                                          reused deliberately —
                                                          see below)
    F  Latur         18.40880 N, 76.56040 E   soybean  (Marathwada soybean belt)
    G  Solapur       17.65990 N, 75.90640 E   jowar    (rabi jowar belt)

D and E use the EXACT SAME (Δlat, Δlng) offset that separates A and B
(-0.00420, +0.01390), at a latitude close enough to Nashik's that the measured
distance is expected to land near the same ~1_530 m — reused rather than
recomputed, since the point is a same-crop pair inside the radius, not a novel
distance. The printed table below reports what PostGIS actually measures, not
what the offset was chosen to produce.

F and G are each the only farm of their crop, so — like paddy-C — they prove
the radius query returns nothing for a crop with no neighbour to warn.

Only same-crop, in-radius pairs propagate: A-B (paddy) and D-E (cotton). F6
never has reason to compare a cotton farm against a soybean or paddy one.

# --- sowing dates ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Nullable in the schema, but seeded here because the F5 phenology branch needs
# farms whose days-after-sowing is consistent with their growth_stage.
# days_after_sowing is NEVER stored — it is derived on read, because a stored
# integer is wrong the next morning and nothing refreshes it.
#
# Paddy (Kharif, transplanted). Phase 1 arithmetic, unchanged:
#
#     nursery      0 - 25      tillering   40 - 65
#     vegetative  25 - 40      booting     65 - 85
#
#     A  tillering   -> DAS 52
#     B  tillering   -> DAS 48   (four days off A, on purpose — see Phase 1)
#     C  vegetative  -> DAS 33
#
# Cotton, soybean, jowar (seed/growth_stages.py has the sourced DAS windows
# per stage; picked here to land inside a phenology rule in
# seed/risk_targets.json so the risk job has something real to score):
#
#     D  squaring       35-55 DAS window -> pick 45  -> within

#        deliberately, so the cotton pair demonstrates two different targets
#        firing rather than the same one twice
#     F  flowering      35-55 DAS window (soybean) -> pick 45 -> within
