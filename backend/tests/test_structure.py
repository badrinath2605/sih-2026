"""Structure-only modules stay structure-only.

Router, service and schema modules start as headers: a docstring naming the
owner, the feature and the specifying docs section, and nothing else. This file
is the mechanical check that the ones still unbuilt remain that way.

It exists because the failure mode is quiet. A placeholder class or a stub route
added "just to get something working" looks like progress and has to be deleted
by the module's real owner before they can start.

IMPLEMENTED is a ledger of built surface. It should grow as phases land, and the
structure-only list shrinks to match — when you implement a module you own, move
it here in the same commit rather than deleting the check.
