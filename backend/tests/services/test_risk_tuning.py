"""F5 tuning: the rules have to carry information.

The job fired on 14 of 15 farm-target pairs. A rule true of almost every day is
not a rule — it is a constant wearing a threshold. These tests pin the four
changes that made the rules discriminate, so a later "small" edit cannot quietly
put the fire rate back to 93%.
