"""The prior cannot move a prediction across a gate band.

docs/DESIGN.md §13 lists this as one of the nine invariants, and §11 says why:
"A prior that can push a prediction over the gate threshold means the system
becomes confident because of history rather than evidence — which is a
fabrication path wearing a statistics hat."

This is a PROPERTY test, not three examples. The whole job of `apply()` is to be
bounded, and a bound is not evidenced by hand-picked cases: it is evidenced by
sweeping the space and finding no counterexample. The sweep below covers every
(top1, top2, bias) combination on a fine grid, including the boundaries
themselves.
