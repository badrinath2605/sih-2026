"""Load the corpus manifest + markdown documents into CorpusDoc.

OWNER: Shreekumar. Spec: docs/DESIGN.md §5 and §8 (v3), docs/DESIGN.md §14.

Run from backend/:

    python scripts/load_corpus.py
    python scripts/load_corpus.py --dry-run

Idempotent on (doc_id, target): for each manifest row, every existing chunk
for that (doc_id, target) pair is deleted and the file's current chunks are
reinserted. Not a per-chunk upsert -- markdown section headings can change
between manifest revisions, so there is no stable per-chunk key to upsert
against, only a stable (doc_id, target) group. See migration
0009_corpus_doc_id_authoritative for the schema reasoning.

Must succeed cleanly on an empty seed/corpus/ directory (no manifest found).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MANIFEST SCHEMA THIS LOADER READS

The 15 delivered documents and their manifest were not in the working tree
when this loader was written (confirmed absent on every branch). The shape
below is this loader's own specification for what it will read once they
land -- built from the fourth-loader-in-the-family brief, not guessed at
blind. If the delivered manifest differs, either the manifest is corrected to
this shape (consistent with every other loader in this family: the input is
what gets fixed) or this loader is revised in a reviewed change, not patched
silently to swallow a different shape.

`seed/corpus/manifest.json`, a JSON object with a `rows` array (plus `_note`
and `DOSAGE_VERIFICATION_NEEDED` strings for the human author -- read by
nobody in this codebase). One row per (document, target) pair -- a two-target
document appears TWICE, once per target, naming the same `doc_id` and
`source_file` both times (docs/DESIGN.md's "ingest that file's chunks once
per target, per the manifest's own note"):

    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "doc_id": "cotton_bollworm_complex_v1",
          "source_file": "cotton/cotton_bollworm_complex_v1.md",
          "crop": "cotton",
          "target": "cotton_american_bollworm",
          "title": "Cotton Bollworm Complex",
          "source": "TNAU Agritech Portal, Crop Protection > Cotton Pests, ...",
          "reviewed_on": "2026-08-31",
          "source_dated": "2024-03-15"
        },
        {
          "doc_id": "cotton_bollworm_complex_v1",
          "source_file": "cotton/cotton_bollworm_complex_v1.md",
          "crop": "cotton",
          "target": "cotton_pink_bollworm",
          "title": "Cotton Bollworm Complex",
          "source": "TNAU Agritech Portal, Crop Protection > Cotton Pests, ...",
          "reviewed_on": "2026-08-31",
          "source_dated": "2024-03-15"
        }
      ]
    }

`source_file` is relative to seed/corpus/. `source_dated` is REQUIRED --
the field the author must positively fill in to assert they know how current
the underlying source material is -- and is validated only, never stored: the
schema's own `reviewed_on` (when the row was last checked) is what lands in
CorpusDoc.reviewed_on. Every row in the first real delivery has
`source_dated: null` and is expected to fail on this until corrected. That is
the validation working, not a bug in this script.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHUNKING

By markdown section (H2, or H1 where a document has no H2), never by a fixed
token window. "Symptoms", "Early Symptoms", "Similar Diseases", "Cultural
Management", "Chemical Management" are natural boundaries and each is
independently meaningful as a retrieval unit -- splitting one in the middle
would return half an idea. See _chunk_markdown().

A heading containing "chemical" (case-insensitive) marks its chunk
authoritative=False. Every delivered document carries a Chemical Management
section written from training knowledge, flagged by the manifest itself as
unverified against any registration table. The corpus text stays available as
background reading; app/core/services/corpus.py's authoritative_chunks() is
the retrieval entry point that filters it out before it can reach anything
that composes a chemical rung. See that module for why the flag exists and
who is responsible for calling the filtered function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VALIDATION -- refuses, never coerces

target      exact member of TargetLabel. No fuzzy matching, no normalisation
            beyond none. A wrong target refused here and silently reattached
            by a smarter loader later is the exact failure mode this rule
            exists to prevent -- see NAME_MAPPING_NEEDED.md, which reports
            the mismatch for a human to fix at the source, and is read by
            nothing in this codebase.
crop        exact member of Crop.
source      must name a specific, findable document -- refused if it exact-
            matches a known generic placeholder, or carries no citation
            signal at all (no URL, no year, no known institution acronym, no
            quoted title). See GENERIC_SOURCE_PHRASES and
            _looks_like_a_real_citation().
source_dated  must be present. Validated only, never stored -- it is the
            author's positive attestation that they know how current the
            underlying source material is. reviewed_on (also manifest-
            supplied) is the value that lands in CorpusDoc.reviewed_on.
content     each markdown section must have non-empty body text once its
            heading line is removed; an empty section is skipped (not a
            document-level refusal) and reported.

Embeddings: no vector-generation path exists in this codebase as of this
loader (searched: no embedding client, no BGE-m3 call, nothing that returns
a `list[float]` -- app.voice.embedding_text.to_embedding_text() produces
normalised TEXT for a query, not a vector, and is the wrong function for
ingestion-time document embedding regardless). Every row loads with
`embedding = NULL`. NULL is an honest "not indexed yet"; generating a vector
with a different, unvetted model to fill the column would be indistinguishable
from a correctly-indexed row and is exactly the kind of silent substitution
this loader family refuses to do anywhere else.
